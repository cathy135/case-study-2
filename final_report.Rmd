# Introduction

Stress can have disastrous long-term effects on the human body [1]. In fact, in 2015, the British Health and Safety Executive found that 37% of work-related illnesses were attributed to stress alone. One way to recognize and mitigate stress is through automated detection methods [2]. Existing wearable devices, which can be wrist or chest-worn, are able to gather relevant physiological data on wearers. Statistical methods can then be applied to construct a mapping from observed sensor data to the wearerâ€™s affective state (e.g. stress). As certain affective states, namely amusement, have similar physiological markers to stress, it is often a difficult task to discriminate between them.

This case study seeks to determine whether sensor data is useful in discriminating between stress and amusement conditions as well as understand the relationship between various physiological features and stress. It further aims to discover which types of sensor data are most useful in discriminating between amusement and stress--that is, can a model built from only wrist sensor data adequately detect stress, or is a combination of wrist and chest-worn sensor data considerably better? Finally, the study seeks to provide a quantification of heterogeneity across different individuals in the response to stress versus amusement. In order to address each of these objectives, we will use a database provided by Schmidt et al [2]. In section __, we will provide a comprehensive overview of the data as well as describe our feature engineering process. Section __ explores the efficacy of wrist-only versus combined sensor data in detecting stress and proposes a logistic regression model with principal components as features. Section __ describes the heterogeneity in stress response among subjects in the study. Our final section discusses limitations and conclusions.

# Data
## Description of Data

A total of 17 individuals participated in the original study. However, due to sensor malfunction for two subjects, only data for 15 subjects was considered in our analysis. Raw data was recorded by two sensor devices: the RespiBAN [3], which is chest worn, and the Empatica E4 [4], which is wrist worn. From the RespiBAN, the following modalities were measured for each individual at 700 Hz: *Electrocardiogram (`ECG`)*, *Electrodermal Activity (`EDA`)*, *Electromyogram (`EMG`)*, *Skin temperature (`TEMP`)*, and *3-axis accelerometry (`ACC`)*. From the Empatica E4, the following modalities were measured for each individual:
*3-axis accelerometry (`ACC`, 32 Hz) *, *Blood Volume Pulse (`BVP`, 64 Hz)*, *Electrodermal Activity (`EDA`, 4 Hz)*, *Skin temperature (`TEMP`, 4 Hz)*, *Heart Rate (`HR`, 1 Hz)*. 

`ECG` measurements record electrical signals in the heart, and are useful in monitoring heart health [5]. `EMG` for the chest measures muscle response to brain signals [6]. `EDA` for both wrist and chest are measures of neurally mediated effects on sweat gland permeability [7]. `TEMP` measures the skin's temperature, in which variability can be an indicator of stress [8]. `ACC` for both wrist and chest is used to record horizontal, vertical, and forward-backward acceleration of object movement. Studies have shown certain additional predictive power for stress detection can be gained by incorporating `ACC` data into the predictive model [9]. `BVP` measures the volume of blood that passes through tissues with each beat of the heart [10]. Finally, `HR`, or the number of heart beats per minute, has been found to vary empirically with affective state [11].
It is important to note that `HR` was not directly measured by the Empatica E4 device, but was instead derived from the BVP measure using a proprietary algorithm [12]. 

## Feature Engineering

In order to combine each of the modalities from the two sensors, we first downsampled each modality (barring heart rate) to 4 Hz. As heart rate was recorded only once per second, we repeated each value four times in order to provide a proxy for a 4 Hz measurement. Using the accelerometer data for the individual X, Y, and Z axes, we derived an additional measure, `ACC 3D`, representing the magnitude of total acceleration. We then proceeded to segment these sensor signals into window sizes of 5 seconds with 0.25 second shifts. Within each window the following features were engineered for each modality: *mean*, *standard deviation*, *minimum value*, and *maximum value*. We adapted this feature engineering process from [13]. Finally, as our study seeks to discriminate between stress and amusement, we filtered our data for only those observations in which the two states were observed. 

## Exploratory Data Analysis
```{r, include = F}
ALL_df = read.csv("master_df.csv", header = T)[,-c(1:2)]

# get rid of chest EDA and temp and all min max (underdispersion)
remove_select_cov = ALL_df %>%
  dplyr::select(-contains("ACC_wrist")) %>%

  dplyr::select(-Temp_mean, -Temp_sd, -Temp_max, -Temp_min) %>%

  dplyr::select(-contains("ECG")) %>%
  dplyr::select(-contains("min")) %>%

  dplyr::select(-contains("ACC_chest_Z_mean")) %>%
  dplyr::select(-contains("ACC_chest_3D_mean")) 

# maybe reorder the variables
col_order <- c("ACC_chest_X_sd", "ACC_chest_Y_sd", "ACC_chest_Z_sd", "ACC_chest_3D_sd", "EMG_mean", "EMG_sd", "Resp_mean", "Resp_sd", "EDA_wrist_mean", "EDA_wrist_sd", "TEMP_wrist_mean", "TEMP_wrist_sd",  "hr_wrist_mu", "hr_wrist_sd", "Subject", "Label")
remove_select_cov <- remove_select_cov[, col_order]

remove_select_cov$Subject <- factor(remove_select_cov$Subject, levels = c("S2", "S3","S4", "S5","S6", "S7","S8", "S9","S10", "S11","S13", "S14","S15", "S16","S17"))

remove_select_cov$Label <- ifelse(remove_select_cov$Label=="2", 1, 0)

non_biological = c("Label", "Subject")
remove_select_cov_nb = remove_select_cov[ , !(names(remove_select_cov) %in% non_biological)]

```

```{r distrib-vs-label, echo=F, fig.width = 10, fig.height = 5}
p1=ggplot(remove_select_cov, aes(y=EDA_wrist_mean, x=factor(Label), group = factor(Label))) + geom_boxplot() + facet_grid(~Subject) +
    labs(x ="State", y = "Mean EDA (wrist)", title = "Fig. 2 Distribution of Mean Wrist EDA by State for All Subjects")

p2=ggplot(remove_select_cov, aes(y=TEMP_wrist_mean, x=factor(Label), group = factor(Label))) + geom_boxplot() + facet_grid(~Subject) +
    labs(x ="State", y = "Mean Temperature (wrist)", title = "Fig. 3 Distribution of Mean Wrist Temperature by State for All Subjects")

grid.arrange(p1, p2, nrow = 1)
```

After examining boxplots of the distribution of physiological measures by state for each subject (see A.__ for all plots of this type), the variables that had the greatest difference in distribution between states and across subjects were `EDA_wrist_mean`, `Temp_wrist_mean`, and `hr_wrist_mu`. Figure 2 indicates that for all subjects, mean EDA values are higher in the stressed state. For subjects 3, 5, 6, 7, 10, and 13, the difference in the distribution of EDA between the two states is more drastic than that of the other subjects. Figure 3 shows that for some subjects, mean wrist temperature is higher in the stressed state. Conversely, other subjects' mean temperatue tends to be lower when stressed, pointing to heterogeneity in stress response. In addition, it is important to note that for certain subjects (such as subject 13), there is no overlap in mean EDA values or mean wrist temperature values between the two states. This is likely to cause perfect separation in logistic regression (see Conclusion for a discussion on potential changes to the experimental design to deal with this issue).

From our correlation matrix (A.__), we see that high collinearity exists among engineered features. Collinearity among covariates can be dangerous in providing unreasonable coefficient estimates with inflated standard errors [14]. As one of our main objectives is to understand the relationship between certain physiological attributes and affective state, it is imperative that model estimates are trustworthy. For this reason,  domain driven insights were useful in selecting certain features to keep in the model, while omitting those contributing to greater multicollinearity. For example, features related to `BVP` and `ECG` measurements were ultimately excluded from our analysis due to their strong relationship with heart rate. As noted earlier, the Empatica E4 provides a measure of heart rate that is algorithmically derived from `BVP`. Heart rate can similarly be derived from `ECG` measurements [15]. Thus, in avoiding redundancy of information, `BVP` and `ECG` features were removed from the analysis, while those regarding heart rate remained. We further opted to remove the mean values of each accelerometry measurement (X, Y, Z, and 3D) over each of the five second windows. Our reasoning for excluding these covariates was due to our belief that variance in motion, which was captured by the standard deviation of accelerometry measurements in each window, is more strongly associated with affective state than average motion [16]. Finally, although we originally computed the minimum and maximum values for each physiological modality, we ultimately omitted these due to issues of underdispersion [17]. Specifically, our exploratory data analysis found that the minimum and maximum measurements across various modalities exhibited small variance. Figure __ in the appendix provides a concrete visualization of these low variances features. 

# Methods
## Model Selection
After reducing the dimensionality of our feature space, we sought to determine the efficacy of the wrist sensor alone in discriminating between stress and amusement. For this purpose, we created two separate logistic regression models--one with data coming only from the wrist sensor, and the other with data coming from both wrist and chest sensors. In these two datasets, we continued to explore methods to reduce dimensionality and account for high correlation between covariates. Techniques such as stepwise variable selection, lasso regularization, and elastic net regularization were considered, but were found ineffective (see A.__ for more detail). In both the wrist-only and combined data models, we ultimately settled on principal component analysis (PCA) as a means of reducing dimensionality and multicollinearity. Based on figures in A.__, we chose to utilize 4 components in both models. For both wrist-only and combined data, original features were normalized (mean-centered and standardized) before the extraction of principal components, as is recommended for PCA [18]. 

Our wrist data considered the following original features, before PCA was performed:
* Wrist `ACC` (X, Y, Z, and 3D): standard deviation 
* Wrist `EDA`: standard deviation and mean
* Wrist `TEMP`: standard deviation and mean
* `HR`: standard deviation and mean

Our combined wrist and chest data considered the following original features, before PCA was performed:
* Chest `ACC` (X, Y, Z, and 3D): standard deviation 
* `EMG`: standard deviation and mean
* Wrist `EDA`: standard deviation and mean
* Wrist `TEMP`: standard deviation and mean
* `HR`: standard deviation and mean

In the combined data, `ACC` measurements coming from the chest sensor were considered, as opposed to the wrist. This choice was motivated by Table 6 in Schmidt et. al [2], which shows the importance of `ACC` features derived from the chest sensor, but not wrist. The same table highlights the importance of `TEMP` and `EDA` related features coming from the wrist worn device, but not chest, warranting our inclusion of `TEMP` and `EDA` features coming from the wrist sensor in our combined data model. The other features for the combined data come from `HR`, which was only provided by the wrist-worn device, and `EMG`, which only comes from the chest-worn.

We then performed PCA for both the wrist only and combined data. The quality of representation plots (A.__) show how much each feature contributes to each of the four components in the wrist-only and combined data models. Darker shades indicate a stronger contribution from a particular covariate to the principal component. As can be seen in the two plots, the resulting principal components are fairly interpretable. For example, for both data sets, standard deviations of `ACC` features contribute strongly to the first component. Thus, this component can be interpreted as a proxy for movement. Temperature and EDA are the main contributors to the second component, showing that it represents information related to dermal temperature and activity (e.g. sweat). The third component relates to heart rate, while the fourth differ slightly between two types of data: the component for wrist only data pertains to variability in temperature, whereas that for the combined data pertains to neuro-muscular activity. We fit two separate logistic regression models using the principal components extracted from the wrist-only and combined data, respectively.

## Model Evaluation
We then investigated the prediction accuracy and f1 scores of each model using a 5-fold cross validation approach. In order to ensure that certain subjects were not over or underrepresented in the testing and training sets, we created stratified folds in which each individualâ€™s representation was proportional to that of their representation in the entire dataset. As indicated in Table __, the combined data model was shown to be superior in both  accuracy and f1 score. 

# Results


A increase of one in the standard deviation for movement and dermal temperature and activity is associated with a multiplicative increase in the odds that the state is stress. A increase of one in the standard deviation of heart rate and neuro-muscular activity is associated with a multiplicative decrease in the odds that the state is stress.

After that, we took the combined data model and added interaction effects between subjects and the principal components to study heterogeneity across subjects in response to stress versus amusement.
